I have created a class which get the value from xml(string) and filter the database. Finaly I have arrays with data concerning this xml value.

I think It can be usefull in other projects. This is not complicated, but it is my first try in PHP OOP.

The files:

worker.php - there is a mechanism which create a cache on local disc, filter data, and generate json.

worker2.php - modification of class Property

script.js - ajax used to show results from class Property

index.php - the interface of my little project
